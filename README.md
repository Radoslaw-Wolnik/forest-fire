# Forest Fire Simulation ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ²

A Rust-based forest fire spread simulator that models fire propagation in a procedurally generated forest grid. 
After a lightning strike ignites a random tree, fire spreads according to a configurable neighborhood strategy, 
and the simulation reports statistics on burned area across multiple runs.

## Features
- **Grid-based forest model** with customizable dimensions
- **Procedural generation** with adjustable tree density
- **Fire spread algorithms**:
    - Moore neighborhood (8-directional)
    - Von Neumann neighborhood (4-directional)
- **Multi-simulation analysis** with min/max/avg burn statistics
- **Real-time CLI visualization** with adjustable frame rate
- **Headless mode** for batch processing and data collection
- **Statistical output** of burned area percentages
- **Modular architecture** easy extensibility following *SOLID* principles


## Project Overview

This project implements a forest fire model on a two-dimensional grid, where each cell may be empty, contain a tree, be burning, or be burned. Trees are randomly placed based on a user-defined density, and a random tree is ignited to simulate a lightning strike. Fire spreads each timestep according to the selected neighborhood (Moore for 8-directional or Von Neumann for 4-directional). Statistics such as minimum, maximum, and average burned percentages are computed over multiple runs.

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.rs        # Command-line argument parsing and configuration struct
â”œâ”€â”€ forest.rs        # Forest grid, cell states, ignition and spread core logic
â”œâ”€â”€ fire_spread.rs   # FireSpreadStrategy trait and neighborhood implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ simulation.rs    # Running multiple simulations and aggregating results
â”œâ”€â”€ display.rs       # CLI visualization engine using crossterm

```

* **config.rs**: Defines a `Config` struct capturing parameters (`size`, `density`, `simulations`, `burn_pattern`, `graphics`, `frame_delay_ms`, `quiet`) and implements parsing from `std::env::args()` with validation.
* **forest.rs**: Implements the `Forest` struct holding the grid (`Vec<Vec<CellState>>`), methods to randomly populate trees, ignite a cell, spread fire per timestep, and compute burn statistics.
* **fire\_spread.rs**: Declares the `FireSpreadStrategy` trait with implementations for `MooreNeighborhood` (8-directional spread) and `VonNeumannNeighborhood` (4-directional spread), plus boundary helpers.
* **simulation.rs**: Contains `run_simulations(config: &Config) -> SimulationResults`, iterating over the configured number of runs, invoking `Forest` creation and spread, and aggregating min/max/average burned percentages.
* **display.rs**: Provides `ForestDisplay` using the `crossterm` crate for animated CLI rendering when `graphics` enabled.
* **main.rs**: Loads `Config`, calls `run_simulations`, and prints formatted results or raw average if `quiet` flag.
* **tests**: Unit tests in each module verifying config parsing, neighborhood correctness, forest initialization, and simulation outputs.

  ```

## Simulation Diagrams

Below are sample outputs from multiple simulations, plotting tree density versus burned percentage. 

Moore:
- Above 60% density all trees will get burned
- Biggest change between 35% to 55%
- Critical threshold at ~40% density where burn percentage sharply increases

Von Neumann:
- Above 80% density all trees will get burned
- Biggest change between 50% to 70%
- Critical threshold at ~55% density where burn percentage sharply increases

## Technical Implementation
### Grid Representation
```rust
enum CellState { Empty, Tree, Burning, Burned }
```
- 2D grid stored as nested `Vec<CellState>`
- Initialized using Fisher-Yates shuffling for precise tree counts

### Fire Propagation
1. Random tree ignition via lightning strike
2. Iterative spread to adjacent cells:
    - Moore: All 8 surrounding cells
    - Von Neumann: Cardinal directions only
3. Simulation terminates when firefront extinguishes

### Performance
- Single-threaded processing of 100x100 grid: ~15ms/trial
- Memory efficient: ~100KB per 100x100 grid
- Batch mode processes 10k trials/min (2.5GHz CPU)

## Optimization Highlights
- **O(1) tree counting**: Maintains exact tree count during generation
- **Firefront queue**: Processes only burning cells each iteration
- **Reservoir sampling**: Efficient random tree selection for ignition
- **Terminal optimizations**: Double-buffered rendering with crossterm

## Testing

Run `cargo test` to verify:

* Config parsing and validation
* Neighborhood algorithms (Moore & VonNeumann)
* Forest initialization and burn spread logic
* Simulation aggregate behavior
