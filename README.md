# Forest Fire Simulation

A Rust implementation of a forest fire spread simulation based on a grid model. This project simulates the spread of fire after a lightning strike in a procedurally generated forest and calculates statistics such as the percentage of burned trees.

---

## Features
- **Grid-based forest model** with customizable dimensions.
- **Random tree generation** with adjustable density.
- **Fire spread simulation** using Moore neighborhood (8-directional spread).
- **CLI visualization** of the forest before/after and during the fire.
- **Statistical analysis** of burned area percentage.
- **Multiple simulation runs** to calculate min max and avg.
- **Configurable parameters** (grid size, tree spawn probability, etc.).
- *Optional extensions*: Wind direction, tree age/resistance river and rock tiles.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/radoslawwolnik/project-forest-fire.git
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

USAGE:
    forest_fire_sim [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -s, --size <size>              Grid size (default: 20)
    -d, --density <density>        Tree density between 0.0 and 1.0 (default: 0.6)
    -c, --simulations <count>      Number of simulations to run (default: 1)
    -b, --burn-pattern <pattern>   Burn pattern: 'moore' or 'vonneumann' (default: moore)
    -g-off, --graphics-off         Disable graphical output (default: enabled)
    -fd, --frame-delay <ms>        Frame delay in milliseconds (1 to 10000, default: 50)

```

#### üîç Description:

* `size`: Sets the width and height of the grid. For example, `-s 100` creates a 100x100 grid.
* `density`: A float between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how densely the trees are populated.
* `simulations`: Number of independent simulation runs.
* `burn-pattern`: Choose how fire spreads:

    * `moore` (default) ‚Äì fire spreads in 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
    * `vonneumann` ‚Äì fire spreads in 4 directions (N, E, S, W)
* `graphics-off`: Disables graphical visualization of the simulation.
* `frame-delay`: Delay in milliseconds between animation frames when graphics is enabled.

#### Example:
```bash
cargo run -- --size 30 --density 0.4 --simulations 1 
```
This simulates a 30x30 forest with 40% tree density across 1 trial with graphical representation.

```bash
cargo run -- -g-off -c 100 -s 100 -d 0.42
```
This simulates a 100x100 forest with 42% tree density across 100 trials without graphic (for speed).

Max burned: 81.82%
Average burned: 81.82%

## Implementation Details
### Grid Representation
- 2D Vec<> of `CellState` enums:
  ```rust
  enum CellState { Empty, Tree, Burning, Burned }
  ```
- Initialized with random trees based on spawn probability.

### Fire Spread Algorithm
1. Random tree is chosen to be ignited.
2. Burning trees spread fire to adjacent cells in each iteration.
3. Simulation continues until no burning trees remain.
